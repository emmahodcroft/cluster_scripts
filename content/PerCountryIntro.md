Graphs show for each country, the proportion of total number of **sequences** (*not cases*), over time, that fall into defined variant groups. Countries are pre-selected to be displayed if they have at least 20 sequences in any variant being tracked (see [colors_and_countries.py](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/scripts/colors_and_countries.pyy)).


Sequences with the 69 deletion or a mutation at <AaMut mut={'S:E484'}/> in Spike are not shown on these plots as they commonly are found in other varaints (Variants <Var name="S:N439K"/>, <Var name="S:Y453F"/>, and <Var name="S:N501"/> for <AaMut mut={'S:H69-'}/>; Variant <Var name="S:N501"/> for <AaMut mut={'S:E484'}/>), so they would be 'double-plotted'.

It is worth interpreting with caution:
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
