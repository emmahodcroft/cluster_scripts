## Mutation Information

<AaMut mut="S:E484"/> has appeared multiple times independently around the world: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations

### S:E484
This mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RBD), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

- Mutations at <AaMut mut="S:E484"/> may significantly reduce convalescent serum neutralization ([Greaney et al., medRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.425021v1))
- There has been a case of reinfection associated with <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>: a woman previously infected with a non-<AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> variant of SARS-CoV-2 was later reinfected with a virus carrying the <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> mutation ([Nonaka et al., PrePrints](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202101.0132/v1))
- In one study co-incubating SARS-CoV-2 with convalescent plasma, neutralization was completely escaped at day 73 due to an <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> mutation ([Andreano et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424451v1))
- In another study co-incubating psueotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and monocolonal antibodies, neutralization both by monoclonal antibodies and to convalescent sera was significantly reduced in viruses with `S:E484` mutations ([Liu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037v1))

The specific mutation <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> is found in 3 variants reported at the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, in:
- South Africa (20H/501Y.V2)
- Brazil (20J/501Y.V3) 
- Brazil (20B/S.484K)

See a <Link href="/shared-mutations">list of shared mutations</Link> for these variants.

More information on each of these variants can be found below.

### 20H/501Y.V2
Also known as `B.1.351`
Announced in December 2020, 501Y.V2 originated and/or initially expanded in South Africa ([Tegally et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248640v1)).

501Y.V2 is associated with multiple mutations in Spike, including: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (<Link href="/variants/S.N501">see <Var name="S:N501" /> page</Link>), <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:D80A'}/>. Additionally, there is a deletion at 242-245.<br/>
There is also a mutation in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:T205I'}/> and a deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) at positions 3675-3677 (also seen in 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V3).

### 20J/501Y.V3
Also known as `P.1`
Announced in January 2021, 501Y.V3 originated and/or initially expanded in Brazil ([Faria et al., Virological](https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manaus-preliminary-findings/586)), and was particularly associated with Manaus, Amazonas.
It has also been identified in travellers arriving in Japan from Brazil ([English Translation of Japanese NIID report](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/diseases/ka/corona-virus/2019-ncov/10107-covid19-33.html), [Naveca et al., Virological](https://virological.org/t/phylogenetic-relationship-of-sars-cov-2-sequences-from-amazonas-with-emerging-brazilian-variants-harboring-mutations-e484k-and-n501y-in-the-spike-protein/585)).

501Y.V3 is associated with multiple mutations in Spike, including: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (<Link href="/variants/S.N501">see <Var name="S:N501" /> page</Link>), <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:H655Y'}/>.
There is also a mutation in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:P80R'}/> and the deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) at positions 3675-3677 (also seen in 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2).

### 20B/S.484K
Announced in January 2021, emerging clade 20B/S.484K, is also thought to have originated and/or initially expanded in Brazil ([de Vasconcelos et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248598v1.article-info)).

Unlike the two variants above, it does *not* carry <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> in Spike.<br/>
It does have mutations in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:A119S'}/> and <AaMut mut={'N:M234I'}/> and in <code>ORF1a</code>: <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:L3458V'}/> and <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:L3930F'}/>.
