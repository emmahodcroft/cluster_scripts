## Mutation Information

- <AaMut mut="S:N501"/> has appeared multiple times independently: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations
- Amino-acid changes are <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (nucleotide mutation <NucMut mut={'A23063T'}/>), <AaMut mut={'S:N501T'}/> (nucleotide mutation <NucMut mut={'A23064C'}/>), and <AaMut mut={'S:N501S'}/> (nucleotide mutation <NucMut mut={'A23064G'}/>)

### S:N501
This mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

- May be associated with adaptation to rodents and mustelids: <AaMut mut={'S:N501T'}/> in ferrets (<LinkExternal href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17367-2">Richard et al., Nature Comm.</LinkExternal>) and mink (<LinkExternal href="https://academic.oup.com/ve/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ve/veaa094/6025194?searchresult=1">Welkers et al., Virus Evolution</LinkExternal>); <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> in mice ([Gu et al. Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/1603)). 
    - Some have speculated on the risk of a possible persistent reservoir in wild rodents/mustelids  
- May increase ACE2 binding [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/) - in particular it is predicted to do this by increasing the time spent in the 'open' conformation ([Teruel et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.423118v2))
- <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> was found in longitudinally-collected samples from an immunocompromised patient (<LinkExternal href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031364?query=featured_coronavirus">Choi et al., NEJM</LinkExternal>)
- In one study, sera from previously infected patients neutralised viruses with <AaMut mut="S:501N"/> and <AaMut mut="S:501Y"/> equally ([Xie et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.425740v1))

The specific mutation <AaMut mut="S:N501Y"/> is found in 3 variants reported at the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, in:
- the UK (20I/501Y.V1)
- South Africa (20H/501Y.V2)
- Brazil (20J/501Y.V3) 

See a <Link href="/shared-mutations">list of shared mutations</Link> for these variants.

More information on each of these variants can be found below. Smaller clusters of sequences with <AaMut mut="S:N501"/> mutations are also found in Wales, the USA, & Australia.

### 20I/501Y.V1
Also known as `B.1.1.7`
Announced on the 14 Dec 2020, appears to have arisen and/or initially expanded in the South East of England.

501Y.V1 is associated with multiple mutations in Spike, including: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/>, a deletion at 69/70 (as seen in variants <Var name="S:N439K"/> and <Var name="S:Y453F"/> (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.422555v3">Kemp et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>) (<Link href="/variants/S.H69-">see <Var name="S:H69-"/> page</Link>)), as well as <AaMut mut={'S:Y144-'}/> (deletion), and <AaMut mut={'S:P681H'}/> (adjacent to the furin cleavage site).
There is also a notable truncation of <code>ORF8</code>, with <AaMut mut={'ORF8:Q27*'}/> (becomes a stop codon) (deletion of <code>ORF8</code> was previously associated with reduced clinical severity (<LinkExternal href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)31757-8/fulltext">Young et al., Lancet</LinkExternal>)), and mutations in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:D3L'}/> and <AaMut mut={'N:S235F'}/>, as well as a deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) 3675-3677  (also seen in 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3).
